                <h2>From Waste to Reuse...</h2>
                <p>
                    We started as a waste management company for homes, businesses, and universities. 
                    As we grew, we saw UK waste was out of control — people didn't know (or care) 
                    what happened to their items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's when Collect 4 Reuse was born. We began partnering with charities, then 
                    later launching our own projects, working directly with organisations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today we're saving tonnes from landfill, disrupting the market positively, 
                    and scaling whilst staying true to our values. If it can be reused, it should be.
