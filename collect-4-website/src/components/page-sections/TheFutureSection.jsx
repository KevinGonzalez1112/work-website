                <p>
                    Nobody can predict what lies ahead, but we know where we want to be. We want to scale our 
                    model nationwide, proving there's a better way. Reuse isn't minor—it's potentially massive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Public mindset is shifting positively, and we must support it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're keen to collaborate with organisations on their reuse journeys, councils, and waste 
                    companies. We've found a key answer for the industry and want to lead it. Get in touch 
                    about projects.
