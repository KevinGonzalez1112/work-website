                At Collect 4 Reuse in Kingston, every donated item finds new purpose. With 
                support from local residents and businesses, we restore furniture, electronics, 
                sports gear, clothing, and more—offering families and community members affordable, 
                sustainable choices for everyday life. Together, we’re diverting waste from 
                landfills and building a stronger circular economy.
